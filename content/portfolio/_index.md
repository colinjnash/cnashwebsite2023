Here is a list of some pages, samples, or projects I've worked on.

## Game engine

1. [Unity UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html): In 2021 I helped plan, reorganize, and write content for a product that had a significant documentation backlog. I'm proud of the work I did to help make this product a success.
2. [Unity SystemGraph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.systemgraph@2.0/manual/index.html): Another great project. I helped organize and structure the SystemGraph documentation to make it more accessible to systems engineers.
3. [Unity SensorSDK](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sensorsdk@2.1/manual/index.html): A personal favorite. One of the best engineering teams I've ever worked with. I'm especially proud of the Get Started section, which was well received by our customers.

## Aerospace & civil aviation

Unfortunately all of my aviation documentation is behind the veil of strict non-disclosure agreements (NDA). But I *can* provide links to the type of work you would expect. Aviation writing usually follows three core rules:

1. Word usage is limited and very prescriptive.
2. All changes must be tracked, no matter how small.
3. All work must follow a strict schema or information architecture.

### Specifications

The following are some examples of specifications I've used during my time in the aviation industry:

- [The ASD-STE100](https://robertobertuol.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASD-STE100-ISSUE-7.pdf) defines all writing specifications for most technical documentation.
- [S1000D](https://s1000d.org/?page_id=101) Another specification for technical publications. In use for mostly maintenance manuals and items that might have multiple variants to allow for modular content when producing publications. Uses "data modules", which might bring happiness or despair to the face of a technical writer, depending on their experience with the specification.
- [ispec2200](https://publications.airlines.org/CommerceHomepage.aspx): Also known as the ATA Standard Numbering System. Unfrotunately access to the manuals are quite expensive, but it essentially gives you the requirements and structure for producing items like an Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM).

### Examples

Here are some examples of aviation technical manuals that aren't behind a non-disclosure agreement:

- [B737NG Flight Crew Training Manual](https://aviation-is.better-than.tv/B737NG_FCTM_(31-10-05).pdf)
- [Q400 Airport Planning Manual](https://customer.aero.bombardier.com/webd/BAG/CustSite/BRAD/RACSDocument.nsf/51aae8b2b3bfdf6685256c300045ff31/ec63f8639ff3ab9d85257c1500635bd8/$FILE/ATTNBEOB.pdf/D8400-APM.pdf)
- [B747 Operations Manual](https://www.manua.ls/boeing/747-441-2000/manual?p=1)
