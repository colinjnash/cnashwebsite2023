Hello! I'm Colin. Welcome to my personal site. For the last few years, I've been working as a technical writer with a focus on new products that want to improve their user journeys. I've documented concepts and procedures for a number of products across many industries. From aviation to cloud platforms, I enjoy taking complex topics and turning them into accessible and engaging content.

What I write is also varied: I've worked on internet copy, technical manuals, civil aviation manuals, and blogs. 

I'm a firm believer that scalable, accessible documentation is a foundation of a successful product. I also think that documentation is its own product, and the key to great documentation is listening to and engaging with your users.

In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with music and programming; the results are probably best left to the imagination.
